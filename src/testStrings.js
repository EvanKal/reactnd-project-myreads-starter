Such virtual geographies are currently being constructed and used at a number of sites and include virtual cities, landscape visualization, visualizing past and future geographies, visualizing abstract concepts and taking people on virtual field courses. Virtual Reality in Geography covers athrough the windowa VR systems, afully immersivea VR systems and hybrids of the two types. The authors examine the Virtual Reality Modeling Language approach, and explore its deficiencies when applied to real geographic environments. This book will be of great interest to geographers, computer scientists and all those interested in multimedia and computer graphics. There is an accompanying CD-ROM containing a rich selection of images and pieces of virtual reality software. This is a totally unique book covering an area of geography that is rapidly becoming used in all aspects of the field. It covers all the major uses and methods of virtual reality used by geographers and the lack of anything else written about the subject to date should ensure a wide readership.

Today we can draw on worldwide computer links, speeding up communications by radio, newspapers, and television. Ideas fly back and forth and circle the globe at the speed of electricity. And just around the corner lurks full-blown virtual reality, in which we will be able to immerse ourselves in a computer simulation not only of the actual physical world, but of any imagined world. As we begin to move in and out of a computer-generated world, Michael Heim asks, how will the way we perceive our world change? In The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, Heim considers this and other philosophical issues of the Information Age. With an eye for the dark as well as the bright side of computer technology, he explores the logical and historical origins of our computer-generated world and speculates about the future direction of our computerized lives. He discusses such topics as the effect of word-processing on the English language (while word-processors have led to increased productivity, they have also led to physical hazards such as repetitive motion syndrome, which causes inflamed hand and arm tendons). Heim looks into the new kind of literacy promised by Hypertext (technology which allows the user to link audio and video elements, the disadvantages including disorientation and cognitive overload). And he also probes the notion of virtual reality, \"cyberspace\"--the computer-simulated environments that have captured the popular imagination and may ultimately change the way we define reality itself. Just as the definition of interface itself has evolved from the actual adapter plug used to connect electronic circuits into human entry into a self-contained cyberspace, so too will the notion of reality change with the current technological drive. Like the introduction of the automobile, the advent of virtual reality will change the whole context in which our knowledge and awareness of life are rooted. And along the way, Heim covers such intriguing topics as how computers have altered our thought habits, how we will be able to distinguish virtual from real reality, and the appearance of virtual reality in popular culture (as in Star Trekas holodeck, William Gibsonas Neuromancer, and Stephen Kingas Lawnmower Man). Vividly and entertainingly written, The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality opens a window on a fascinating world that promises--or threatens--to become an integral part of everyday life in the 21st century. As Heim writes, not only do we face a breakthrough in the technology of computer interface, but we face the challenge of knowing ourselves and determining how the technology should develop and ultimately affect the society in which it grows.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780198024323"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0198024320"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":208,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.0.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EF6a-UJf-OcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EF6a-UJf-OcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EF6a-UJf-OcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EF6a-UJf-OcC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://market.android.com/details?id=book-EF6a-UJf-OcC","id":"EF6a-UJf-OcC"},{"title":"Understanding Virtual Reality","subtitle":"Interface, Application, and Design","authors":["William R.

The VR Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design. Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of understanding human perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR, such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR applications. This book is not just for VR designers, it is for managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user experience professionals. It is for the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at least the basics of the many aspects of VR design. The industry is rapidly evolving, and The VR Book stresses the importance of building prototypes, gathering feedback, and using adjustable processes to efficiently iterate towards success. With extensive details on the most important aspects of VR, more than 600 applicable guidelines, and over 300 additional references, The VR Book will bring a strong foundation for anyone and everyone involved in creating VR experiences.\"","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1970001127"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781970001129"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":638,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8rh2jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8rh2jgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rh2jgEACAAJ&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rh2jgEACAAJ&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_VR_Book.html?hl=&id=8rh2jgEACAAJ","id":"8rh2jgEACAAJ"},{"title":"Virtual reality","authors":["Howard Rheingold"],"publisher":"Harvill Secker","publishedDate":"1991","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0436412128"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780436412127"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":415,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJn5MAAACAAJ&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJn5MAAACAAJ&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Virtual_reality.html?hl=&id=ZJn5MAAACAAJ","id":"ZJn5MAAACAAJ"},{"title":"Virtual Reality","authors":["Holly Cefrey"],"publisher":"Childrens Press","publishedDate":"2002","description":"Introduces virtual reality, exploring the technology involved and looking toward what the future might bring as VR is used more widely in entertainment, education, science, and medicine.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0516239198"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780516239194"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":48,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Nonfiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aBwwQXHOjHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aBwwQXHOjHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aBwwQXHOjHwC&q=virtual+reality&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aBwwQXHOjHwC&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Virtual_Reality.html?hl=&id=aBwwQXHOjHwC","id":"aBwwQXHOjHwC"},{"title":"Virtual Reality in Neuro-psycho-physiology","subtitle":"Cognitive, Clinical and Methodological Issues in Assessment and Rehabilitation","authors":["Giuseppe Riva"],"publisher":"IOS Press","publishedDate":"1997-01-01","description":"To create successful health care applications with todayas virtual environments, we must begin by asking: what are they good at? This book offers an answer to its potential readers - physicians, psychologists and health care provider - by presenting an overview of the current research in this field. In fact, the book, whose idea comes from the work made within the EC funded Virtual Reality Environments for Psycho-neuro-physiological assessment and Rehabilitation VREPAR - project, (HC 1053 - www.etho.be/ht_projects/vrepar), is a collection of chapters from researchers who have pioneered the ideas and the technology associated with virtual reality. More in particular, the book discusses the clinical principles, human factors, and technology issues associated with the use of virtual reality for assessment and treatment. It should be noted that technical characteristics of virtual worlds change very rapidly, but what will not change is the user of the virtual environment. Thus, to ensure that the contents of this book are not quickly updated, all the contributors have made a great effort to identify possible constraints in the use of this technology and to indicate how they can be faced and solved. The key issue was to integrate knowledge of clinical therapy and psychological principles related to human factors into the design of virtual environments. The book is divided in three main sections comprising 13 chapters overall: virtual reality for health care, virtual reality for psychological assessment and rehabilitation and virtual reality for neuro-physiological assessment and rehabilitation.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"9051993641"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9789051993646"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":209,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.1.0.preview.1","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e3dT_29znBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e3dT_29znBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e3dT_29znBoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e3dT_29znBoC&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Virtual_Reality_in_Neuro_psycho_physiolo.html?hl=&id=e3dT_29znBoC","id":"e3dT_29znBoC"},{"title":"Virtual Reality","authors":["Lisa Yount"],"publishedDate":"2004","description":"Discusses the history, present uses, and future of the technology of virtual reality.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1590181077"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781590181072"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":112,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Juvenile Nonfiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uw6kTiv_xNYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uw6kTiv_xNYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uw6kTiv_xNYC&q=virtual+reality&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uw6kTiv_xNYC&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Virtual_Reality.html?hl=&id=uw6kTiv_xNYC","id":"uw6kTiv_xNYC"},{"title":"Communication in the Age of Virtual Reality","authors":["Frank Biocca","Mark R.

In this pioneering book, philosopher Thomas Langan explores \"virtual reality\"Can inherently contradictory phrase\"and the effects of technology on our very being. In our present-day high- technology environment, making simple, everyday decisions is difficult because the virtual world weave created doesnat necessarily operate according to the old \"common sense.\" To retain our intellectual fitness, we must, Langan argues, consider these essential questions: If virtual reality is, in fact, reality, what is this life that we are caught up in? What is being within the context of virtual reality? How can we establish a system for distinguishing truth from fiction? Although technology minimizes distances between people and makes the information they seek more accessible, it simultaneously blurs the line dividing fact from falsehood and real from virtual. An individualas intellectual survival is threatened as technological advancement challenges our collective understanding of what reality is. Because much of the information that is presented as fact simply works to fulfill a specific agenda, we cannot accept as truth everything that appears on the internet or in the media. To survive, we must learn to manage our lives and resources despite the flood of information we are bombarded with daily.

Westwood"],"publisher":"IOS Press","publishedDate":"2008-01-01","description":"We humans are tribal, grouping ourselves by a multitude of criteria: physical, intellectual, political, emotional, etc. The Internet and its auxiliary technologies have enabled a novel dimension in tribal behavior during our recent past. This growing connectivity begs the question: will individuals and their communities come together to solve some very urgent global problems? At MMVR, we explore ways to harness information technology to solve healthcare problems - and in the industrialized nations we are making progress. In the developing world however, things are more challenging. Massive urban poverty fuels violence and misery. Will global networking bring a convergence of individual and tribal problem-solving? Recently, a barrel-shaped water carrier that rolls along the ground was presented, improving daily life for many people. Also the One Laptop per Child project is a good example of how the industrialized nations can help the developing countries. They produce durable and simple laptops which are inexpensive to produce. At MMVR, we focus on cutting-edge medical technology, which is generally pretty expensive. While the benefits of innovation trickle downward, from the privileged few to the broader masses, we should expand this trickle into a flood. Can breakthrough applications in stimulation, visualization, robotics, and informatics engender tools as ingeniously as the water carrier or laptop? With some extra creativity, we can design better healthcare for the developing world too.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781586038229"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1586038222"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":574,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Medical"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JfIiwky12bIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JfIiwky12bIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JfIiwky12bIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JfIiwky12bIC&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Medicine_Meets_Virtual_Reality_16.html?hl=&id=JfIiwky12bIC","id":"JfIiwky12bIC"},{"title":"Virtual Reality","subtitle":"A Selected Bibliography","authors":["Hilary McLellan"],"publisher":"Educational Technology","publishedDate":"1992","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0877782466"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780877782469"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":120,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.0.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iexdQcW0aSwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iexdQcW0aSwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iexdQcW0aSwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=virtual+reality&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iexdQcW0aSwC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://market.android.com/details?id=book-iexdQcW0aSwC","id":"iexdQcW0aSwC"},{"title":"The Virtual Reality Casebook","authors":["Carl Eugene Loeffler","Tim Anderson"],"publisher":"Coriolis Group","publishedDate":"1994-01-01","description":"This book covers Virtual Reality with authority, from business applications such as training simulations and design mockups to the cutting edge of VR in education, art and entertainment.
